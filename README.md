# Hiragana Learner Randomizer Game
A simple, yet effective, Hiragana Syllabary randomization game for Android.

## Application Objective
This app aims to help learners of the Japanese language, quickly make visual associations with the Hiragana letters and 
their associated Hepburn romanizations.

<i>For more info on Hiragana, please refer to this page:</i>
[Wikipedia - Hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana)

### How it works?
Once the user starts the game, the app's algorithm generates a random order of the 48 most common Hiragana letters. And presents 
the user with a random letter and four options of romanizations. The user simply has to select the romanization that matches 
the current letter on the screen. Once the user selects a romanization, he clicks on a button to verify his answer. If his answer is correct,
he scores a point. Else, he is alerted about his answer, and a dialog shows the correct romanization for that letter.
<p>Once the user goes though all the letters, he will be directed to a score screen, where he can share his final game score
and finish the game.</p>
